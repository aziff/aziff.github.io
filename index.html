<p>Research Interests: Public, Urban, Labor</p>


<p>My current research agenda includes two streams. First, I study the effectiveness and social efficiency of place-based policies, considering the responses of households and firms. Second, I study the role of place in economic outcomes of households.</p>

<p>I will begin as an Assistant Professor at Texas A&M in the Fall.</p>
