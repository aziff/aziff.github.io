<p>My job market paper proposes an approach to study spillover effects of local policies that propagate through latent markets instead of only spatially. While the approach is particularly relevant for place-based economic development, it can be adapted to other contexts. </p>

<p>I exemplify the approach with a particular place-based policy and estimate spillover effects within latent housing markets. To characterize housing markets, I apply an approach in network theory to household moves. The empirical findings inform conclusions on overall effectiveness and redistribution that vary from analysis using only direct treatment effects.</p>



<p>I am on the 2023-2024 job market.</p>
