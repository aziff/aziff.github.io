<p>I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at Duke University.</p> 

<p>My research agenda includes three categories of projects related to place-based policies.</p>



<ol>
	<li>The efficiency and equity consequences of interventions that are targeted based on geographic characteristics (e.g., infrastructure investment). </li>
	<li> The role of place in household outcomes (e.g., income volatility).</li>
	<li>Measurement and econometric issues related to the study of place-based policies.
</ol>
