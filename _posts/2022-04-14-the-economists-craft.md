In January, I read _The Economist's Craft_ by Michael S. Weisbach (Princeton University Press, 2021). The intended audience includes Ph.D. students and early-career professors, although I  think this book would be useful for those considering a Ph.D. in Economics also. It contains concrete, relevant, and reasonable advice. The one omission seems to be teaching. I think some discussion of how to integrate teaching into the "craft" of a research career would have been useful. That being said, I think the book is otherwise  comprehensive.

I have summarized the pointers that resonated with me the most. 

### Advice on Brainstorming and Evaluating Potential Research Questions

1. Even for a Ph.D. student, it is important to work towards a cohesive research agenda. Weisbach has many specific tips for this, for example:
    * Create a market map, listing all topics in a broad topic and related papers. This can help narrow down interesting and feasible research questions.
    * Study the whole problem, not just the easiest part to analyze.

2. Weisbach suggests an exercise to evaluate possible reserach questions. Write a 3-4 page introduction with the anticipated results. Is the topic and motivation interesting even without the analysis? How much would the interest in this project depend on the exact results?


### Advice on Writing and Communicating

1. "The write up is the research." The write up and all research communication should be taken seriously.
2. Weisbach helpfully breaks down the goals of the research write up:
    - Convince the reader the paper is new and interesting
    - Convince the reader the analysis is correct and addresses the problem
    - Credit other work
    - Detail the research process
    - Draw appropriate conclusions

3. Think about the structure of the paper before implementing the usual format. Making section titles more descriptive can help guide the reader.
4. If a standalone literature review section is necessary, structure it based on ideas rather than on papers. Also, be profesional when deciding which papers to cite and how to discuss the work.
5. Writing a useful data section keeps readers engaged and can be valuable to others, even if they are studying completely different questions.

### General Professional Advice

1. Be professional in all interactions, including online, and with peers, mentors, and mentees.
2.  Solicit feedback from peers and mentors, being mindful of using their time and energy efficiently. 
3. When others ask for your help reviewing writing, take the time to provide thoughtful and constructive feedback. 


The above pointers are a small sampling of wealth of information and advice that Weisbach shares. Overall, I found it to be an incredibly enjoyable and useful book.
