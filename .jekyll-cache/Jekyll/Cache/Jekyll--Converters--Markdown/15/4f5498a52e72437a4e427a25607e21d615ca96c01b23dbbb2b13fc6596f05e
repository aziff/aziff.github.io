  <li>Econ 890-02: R for Economists
    <ul>
      <li>I designed this class for Ph.D. students and master‚Äôs students interested in pursuing empirical research in economics. I taught this class in an online format Summer 2021.
        <ul>
          <li><em>Overview: Paired with modern packages and a personalized workflow, economists can use R to efficiently clean, analyze, and visualize large amounts of data. The class starts from the foundations of coding in R, building up to graphing, mapping, and other outputs from statistical testing. Throughout, the class activities encourage students to consider and practice the tenants of successful coding, including clarity, simplicity, and generality. The workflow can define the work; students develop their own workflow that allows them to organize their code and research. These workflow skills are useful even in other languages and programs. The capstone project is an independent research project on a topic of the student‚Äôs choosing, or a replication of a published economics paper.</em></li>
