<p>In January, I read <em>The Economist’s Craft</em> by Michael S. Weisbach (Princeton University Press, 2021). The intended audience includes Ph.D. students and early-career professors, although I  think this book would be useful for those considering a Ph.D. in Economics also. It contains concrete, relevant, and reasonable advice. The one omission seems to be teaching. I think some discussion of how to integrate teaching into the “craft” of a research career would have been useful. That being said, I think the book is otherwise  comprehensive.</p>

<p>I have summarized the pointers that resonated with me the most.</p>

<h3 id="advice-on-brainstorming-and-evaluating-potential-research-questions">Advice on Brainstorming and Evaluating Potential Research Questions</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Even for a Ph.D. student, it is important to work towards a cohesive research agenda. Weisbach has many specific tips for this, for example:
    <ul>
      <li>Create a market map, listing all topics in a broad topic and related papers. This can help narrow down interesting and feasible research questions.</li>
      <li>Study the whole problem, not just the easiest part to analyze.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Weisbach suggests an exercise to evaluate possible reserach questions. Write a 3-4 page introduction with the anticipated results. Is the topic and motivation interesting even without the analysis? How much would the interest in this project depend on the exact results?</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="advice-on-writing-and-communicating">Advice on Writing and Communicating</h3>

<ol>
  <li>“The write up is the research.” The write up and all research communication should be taken seriously.</li>
  <li>Think about the structure of the paper before implementing the usual format. Making section titles more descriptive can help guide the reader.</li>
  <li>If a standalone literature review section is necessary, structure it based on ideas rather than on papers. Also, be profesional when deciding which papers to cite and how to discuss the work.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="general-professional-advice">General Professional Advice</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Be professional in all interactions, including online, and with peers, mentors, and mentees.</li>
  <li>Solicit feedback from peers and mentors, being mindful of using their time and energy efficiently.</li>
  <li>When others ask for your help reviewing writing, take the time to provide thoughtful and constructive feedback.</li>
</ol>

<p>The above pointers are a small sampling of wealth of information and advice that Weisbach shares. Overall, I found it to be an incredibly enjoyable and useful book.</p>
